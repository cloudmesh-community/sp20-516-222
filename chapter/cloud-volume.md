# Volume Management on Clouds

* sp20-516-222 Peter McCandless

## Introduction

Volume in the cloud can be manipulated to optimally accommodate the process being performed and the data being stored in the cloud.  There are three types of storage in the cloud.  File storage typically takes the same hierarchical structure as a directory with a path to each file.  Object storage usually takes the form of a data lake in which unstructured data is labeled with metadata that is used to locate the data for processing and analysis.  Block storage divides data into evenly-sized volumes with each block having its own address.
