Hydroelectric power is genrated from the force of running water pushing a turbine.  Hydroelectric power accounts for over 70% of all renewable energy gerenated in the world.  The most common method for producing hydroelectircity is the use of a dam from which the flow of water from a resivour can be controlled to match the power needs [3].  While the use of hydroelectric dams produces much lass CO2 than burning fossil fuels, dams can cause harm to the environment by altering water quality and disrupting wildlife habitats [4].  Data centers that are pwoered by hydroelectricity include Aruba S.p.A.'s Global Cloud Data Center in Milan, Italy and FaceBook's data center in Lulea, Sweden [5][6].
